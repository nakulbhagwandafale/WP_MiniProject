                    <h1> Rainwater Harvesting:</h1>

                    Collecting and storing rainwater from rooftops or other surfaces can be an efficient
                    way to supplement water supply. This harvested rainwater can be used for various non-potable
                    purposes such as watering plants, flushing toilets, or washing vehicles.

                    <h1> Drip Irrigation:</h1>

                    Drip irrigation delivers water directly to the base of plants, minimizing evaporation and runoff.
                    This targeted watering method is more efficient than traditional sprinkler systems, reducing water
                    wastage and ensuring that plants receive the necessary moisture.

                    <h1> Xeriscaping:</h1>

                    Xeriscaping involves designing landscapes with water-efficient plants that are well-suited to the
                    local climate. This reduces the need for excessive watering, as these plants are adapted to thrive
                    with minimal water requirements.

                    <h1>Water-Efficient Appliances:</h1>

                    Upgrading to water-efficient appliances, such as low-flow toilets, faucets, and showerheads, can
                    significantly reduce household water consumption. These appliances are designed to maintain
                    functionality while using less water.

                    <h1>Greywater Recycling:</h1>

                    Greywater is wastewater from household activities like laundry, dishwashing, and bathing. Treating
                    and recycling greywater for non-potable uses, such as irrigation or flushing toilets, helps conserve
                    fresh water and reduces the overall demand on water supply systems.

                    <h1> Fixing Leaks:</h1>

                    Identifying and repairing leaks in plumbing and irrigation systems is a simple yet effective way to
                    prevent water wastage. Even small leaks can add up to significant water losses over time, and fixing
                    them ensures that water is used more efficiently.
